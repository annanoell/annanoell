# About me

I’ve been developing apps and webs since 2011. I have always worked as a freelancer for all kind of companies. I’m a fast learner and I feel comfortable working under pressure in fast changing environments. I’m a big fan of agile methodology and I apply it both in my professional and personal life. I’m good at solving problems in a creative way and I’m stubborn when a challenge arises.
I follow the SOLID principles to make my code clean and readable. Tests are a must. I use Kotlin and MVVM nowadays but I feel confortable with Java and MVP or MVC also.
In all these years I’ve worked in all type of projects, from simple API readers to complex apps using Bluetooth or GPS.
